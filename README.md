##Day 1: 
Today's Progress: completed the alternate, compareTriplet and minimumPassword challenges. 
**#1** compareTriplet: compare the value of two arrays and determine the comparison points.

**#2** minimumPassword: find the minumum of the characters to add to make sure the passport meets criteria. 

Thoughts:  This challenges reminds me to reveiw the regular expression and syntaxes. 1)use conditions to figure out how many kinds of criteras current password met. 2) calculate the length of current password and have conditions to check whether the current length meets and minumum length requirement. 


**#3** Alternate: remove the letters of a string and find the longest string that contains only two alternating letters.

Thoughts: 
#3 I struggled on this one and it took a while. I learned about the functions of regular expression, like match().replace().Also use new RegExp to write regular expression variables, like new RegExp(`[^${letters[i]}${letters[j]}]`, 'g').
